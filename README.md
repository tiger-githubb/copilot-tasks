# Copilot Tasks

A Markdown-based task manager integrated into VS Code, designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Copilot. Organize your tasks in a `todo.md` file, enjoy an intuitive sidebar interface, and leverage the power of Copilot to help write or improve your tasks.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Core Task Management

- **Real-time synchronization**: Changes in the editor automatically reflect in the sidebar and vice versa

### üå≤ Sidebar Interface

- **TreeView display**: View all tasks in a dedicated sidebar panel
- **Category grouping**: Tasks are automatically grouped by their markdown headers
- **Visual indicators**: Different icons for completed (‚úÖ) and pending (‚è≥) tasks
- **Click to toggle**: Click any task in the sidebar to mark it as complete/incomplete
- **Flexible grouping**: Toggle between categorized and flat list views

### ‚ö° Commands & Actions

- **Open Todo File**: Quickly access your `todo.md` file
- **Add New Task**: Add tasks via command palette with optional categories
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Mark tasks as done/undone from command palette or sidebar

- **Refresh Tasks**: Reload tasks from file
